# Unstumpable

You're given four Donald Trump tweets... but only one is real! The other three tweets are from parody accounts. Can you figure out which one is real?

Every consecutive question you get right gives you one point.

The backend was written in Python using the Sanic framework. We stored all of our tweets in a MySQL database. The frontend was done entirely out of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap. The SMS-based functionality was provided by Twilio. The application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
